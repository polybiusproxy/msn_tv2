<p>
When you purchase a wireless bridge, you use the bridge's setup software to 
configure and store applicable network settings on the bridge itself, e.g., SSID name, 
WEP key, and DHCP settings. For this setup task, you will need to use a computer 
(equipped with CD-ROM) on your home network.  
</p>
<p>

Setup software varies among wireless bridge products, but the connection steps below 
should apply in most cases. 
</p>

<p>

To connect your your Internet & Media Player to your wireless home network using a wireless
 bridge, follow these steps:
</p>
<p> 
<ul>
<li>
Follow the setup instructions that came with the wireless bridge, and use the Ethernet cable that came with the bridge to connect the bridge to your computer.
</li>
<li>
Insert the bridge software CD and launch setup as needed. When prompted, specify the addressing type your network uses (DHCP, for example), your SSID name, and a WEP key (if required).
</li>
<li>When your computer is successfully connected to your wireless network, disconnect the bridge's Ethernet cable from your computer and then connect it to the Ethernet port on the back of the Internet  & Media Player. (The bridge’s stored settings will automatically activate your Internet  & Media Player’s wireless connection.) 
</li>
<li>You're now ready to connect to both your home network and your broadband Internet service.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
NOTE:  When using a wireless bridge, your Internet & Media Player’s internal Wireless settings do not apply.
