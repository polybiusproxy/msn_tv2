        The blue Messages light on the front of your Internet & Media Player can tell you when you have new e-mail. 
		It can even check for new mail when you're signed out. But you'll have to set it up.
		</p>
        <p>
        Note: If you want your Messages light to work while you're signed out, you must save your password on the Sign-in page.
		</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose <b>Settings</b> from the Sign-in page.</li>
			<li>Choose <b>Set up automatic updates</b>.</li>
            <li>Check the box labeled <b>Check for new mail while I'm signed out</b>.</li>
			<li>Choose the box to the right of <b>Check for new mail every</b> and press <b>OK</b> to see a list of time intervals.</li>
			<li>Choose how often you want the Player to check for new mail. (If you are using a dial-up connection, 
				this involves a phone call to the MSN TV Service each time.) You can also choose when the Player will 
				start checking for mail. Move the yellow highlight box to the line that says <b>Check for updates around</b> 
				and choose a time.</li>
			<li>Choose <b>Save Changes</b>.</li>
			<li>On the Sign-in page, enter your password and make sure to check the box that says <b>Save password so I 
				don't need to retype it</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        The blue light will illuminate when a person who is signed in gets new mail. If no one is signed in, then it lights 
		up when anyone with a saved password gets mail. In that case, the Sign-in page will display the words <b>New mail</b> 
		next to whoever has mail waiting.
